Steam Banner Downloader

by Sciguymjm


This is a simple Python script that scans your SteamApps directory and downloads the correct banners automatically.

These are the banners found on the Steam website and can be used to feature games on a website or show them off to your friends.

To run, simply type "python banner.py" in the console to begin. The program will prompt you for information. No Steam information (usernames/passwords) is used.
